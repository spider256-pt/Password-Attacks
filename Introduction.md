- `Confidentiality`, `integrity` and `availability` `{CIA traid}` are at the core of every infosec practitioner's responsibility. 
- This balance is preserved by auditing and accounting for each file, object and host in the environment, by validating that users have appropriate `permissions(authorizations)` to access the resources and by verifying each user's `identity(authentication)`. 

### Authentication:

- ==`Authentication`== is the validation of identity by presenting a combination of four factors to a validation mechanism. They are:
	- Something you know
	- Something you have 
	- Something you are
	- Somewhere you are
- This process  can require any or all of these authentication factors
- These method will be determined based on the severity of the information or systems accessed and how much protection is need.

- ## The use of Passwords:
	- The most common and widely authentication method is still the use of passwords.
	- ==`Password`==: Can be defined as the `combination of letters`, `numbers` and `symbols in a string for identity validation`
